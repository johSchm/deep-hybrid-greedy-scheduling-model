# Approaching Scheduling Problems via a Deep Hybrid Greedy Model and Supervised Learning

This is the official paper repository for our paper 'Approaching Scheduling Problems via a Deep Hybrid Greedy Model and Supervised Learning'.

## Requirements 

- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 2.3

## Installation

We suggest to create a virtual environment first via
```
python -m venv venv
```
and install the required packagees with
```
venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure 

- *config.yaml* contains all the most important settings.
- *model_training.ipynb* is a jupyter notebook, which comprises the model training pipeline.
- *inference.ipynb* is a jupyter notebook, that can be used for analysing the model predictions.
- *ckpts* contains checkpoints of the model stored during training.
- *data* contains the generated dataset.
- *log* contains tensorboard log files.
- *model* contains the neural network model.
- *plots* comprises some figures.
- *src* contains all the source code files used in the notebooks.
- *venv* is the virtual environment.
